# RL394 Final Project Code
#Connect-4 Reinforcement learning

#game.py is the code for connect-4 game logic
#agent.py contains the various agent classes used to train our RL agent, sarsaagent, as well as the feature vector extraction functions that sarsaagent utilizes.
#sarsalambda.py contains the learning algorithm to train the agent.
#runtime.ipynb is the python notebook where we execute training, plot performance metrics, and run evaluation iterations.
